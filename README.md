# Organelle + Monome

## Hardware

  - Critter + Gutari Organelle
  - Monome 128 Grayscale
  - Powered USB Hub

Half of my 128's LEDs weren't lit when powered from the USB port on the Organelle, the addition of the powered USB hub solved this. A 64 might not need a hub.

## How to Use

Copy the example patches to the Patches folder on the USB drive.

### Monome-Install

Run this patch first. Follow the instructions on the OLED. Press AUX to start installation.

After installation, all the monome's LED's should blink, and then each key's LED should illuminate when pressed. The Organelle should display the last key pressed x y and state.

### Monome Basic Poly

After running Monome-Install, try this patch. Rach key press lights the coresponding LED, and plays sounds based on the Basic Poly patch that shipped with the Organelle.
