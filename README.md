# Organelle + Monome

## Hardware

  - Critter + Gutari Organelle
  - Monome 128 Grayscale
  - Powered USB Hub

Note: Half of my 128's LEDs weren't lit when powered from the USB port on the Organelle, the addition of the powered USB hub solved this. A 64 might not need a hub.

## How to Use

1. Copy the patches to the Patches folder on the Organelle's USB drive.

2. Copy the entire include folder to the root of the Organelle's USB drive, so it looks like this:

    Patches/
    include/

Two patches are included:

## Monome

All the LED's should blink, and then each key's LED should illuminate when pressed. The Organelle should display the last key pressed x y and state.

## Monome Basic Poly

The same thing as Monome, but each key plays sounds based on the Basic Poly patch that shipped with the Organelle.
