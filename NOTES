# Optional/Alternative: Send/Receive raw bytes with ComPort

I've also included a test patch to experiment with sending serial directly to the Monome via [comport]. This is included just to be thourough, and could be useful for other serial interfaces, such as Arduino.

## Install [comport]

via https://puredata.info/community/pdwiki/ComPort

    cd /root/externals/
    svn co https://svn.code.sf.net/p/pure-data/svn/trunk/externals/iem/comport/comport/
    cd comport
    make

## PureData from the GUI and add ComPort to your externals path.

1. Navigate to File > Preferences > Path.
2. Click "New"
3. Browse to /root/externals/comport
4. Click "OK"

## Open Monome Test Patch

Plug in your Monome and open monome-comport.pd.
